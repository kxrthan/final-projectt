      1. **Functionality**: Preserve all functionality and logic from the original code without modifications or omissions.
      2. **Optimization**: Ensure the converted code is optimized for:
         - **Readability**: Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
         - **Performance**: Write efficient code using the best practices for ${targetLanguage}.
         - **Maintainability**: Ensure modularity and proper code organization.
      3. **Modern Standards**: Apply ${targetLanguage} conventions and features, such as object-oriented design, async/await (if applicable), or native constructs.
      4. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling to manage edge cases and potential runtime errors.
      5. **Input/Output**: Implement file handling and I/O operations according to ${targetLanguage} standards.
      6. **Simplicity**: Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. Use built-in libraries or language features unless external libraries are essential.
      7. **Output Format**: Provide the converted code formatted properly for ${targetLanguage}. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text.
      
      Respond with only the converted code, no other text should be there in the converted code. Ensure the output is free of any extraneous text or commentary.`
